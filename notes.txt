      The Milwaukee County Public Links Association was founded in 1934 with the purpose of promoting golf in Milwaukee County through inter-club competition. The Brown Deer, Currie, Grant, and Greenfield Golf Clubs formed the nucleus of the organization.

      The Whitnall, Dretzka and Oakwood Golf Clubs joined between 1953 and 1972. Today, these seven clubs include almost one thousand golfers and provide their members with a varied calendar of competitions. Each club member is also a member of the Wisconsin Public Links Association and the Wisconsin State Golf Association.
